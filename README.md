# AINB file viewer

A tool to view `.ainb` files, as seen in Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Tears of the Kingdom, and more.

**NOTE: This program is still in a very early stage of development. Expect bugs, crashes, and incorrect parsing of files.**

## Current features

- Can read most sections of `.ainb` files
- Can view SARC files (e.g. `.pack` files use this)
